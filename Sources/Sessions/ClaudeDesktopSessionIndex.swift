/// Which account a session the Claude desktop app hosts actually belongs to.
///
/// Claude Code files its session registry inside whatever `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
/// names, and the desktop app leaves that variable unset — so every session the
/// app hosts lands in `~/.claude/sessions`, the *default* profile's directory,
/// whichever account the app is signed in to. Switching account inside the app
/// changes the credential and changes nothing about where the file goes. That
/// is why a second profile's work spun the default profile's ring: the registry
/// entry is filed by directory, and the directory is not the account.
///
/// Nothing in the registry entry names the account either. But the desktop app
/// keeps its own record of every session it has hosted, one directory per
/// account:
///
///     ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude-code-sessions/
///         <accountUuid>/<organizationUuid>/<hostSessionId>.json
///
/// and the registry entry carries that `hostSessionId`. So the two join on it,
/// entirely locally: no network, no keychain, nothing sent anywhere. The uuid
/// on our side is `ClaudeProfile.accountID()`, read from the same `.claude.json`
/// the Settings row's address comes from.
///
/// Not a general directory index on purpose. A session is asked about by id,
/// and the answer is a handful of `stat` calls down two shallow levels — far
/// less than enumerating every session the app has ever hosted on a machine
/// that has been in use for a year.
